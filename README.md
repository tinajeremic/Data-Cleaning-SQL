# 📊 Data Cleaning: World Layoffs Dataset

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project focuses on cleaning a dataset of recorded layoffs from various global companies. The raw data contained inconsistencies such as missing values, duplicate records and formatting issues. Using SQL, I performed data cleaning to ensure accuracy, consistency and usability for further analysis.

### ✅ Issues in the Raw Data  
1. **Missing Values** → Handled blank and `NULL` values in key columns
